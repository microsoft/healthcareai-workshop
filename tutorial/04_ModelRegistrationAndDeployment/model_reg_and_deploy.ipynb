    "# Model Registration and Deployment with Azure Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the end-to-end process of selecting, registering, and deploying a pneumonia detection model using Azure Machine Learning. After completing hyperparameter tuning, this notebook guides you through analyzing model performance, selecting the best model, registering it in the Azure ML model registry, deploying it as a real-time inference endpoint, and validating the deployment with actual X-ray images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, you should have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An Azure Machine Learning workspace with appropriate permissions.\n",
    "- Completed the model training and hyperparameter tuning process (sweep job).\n",
    "- Access to the dataset for testing the deployed model.\n",
    "- The necessary Python packages installed.\n",
    "- Proper authentication configured for your Azure environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Do\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analyze hyperparameter sweep results** - Review metrics from multiple training runs to identify the best-performing model configuration\n",
    "- **Register the optimal model** - Create a versioned model asset in the Azure ML model registry with proper metadata\n",
    "- **Deploy to a managed online endpoint** - Configure and deploy the model as a scalable REST API service on Azure\n",
    "- **Test model inference** - Validate the deployed endpoint by sending a real X-ray image and receiving predictions"

    "\n",
    "This cell analyzes the results from our completed hyperparameter sweep, allowing us to identify the best-performing model configuration based on validation metrics. Hyperparameter tuning is a critical step in the machine learning workflow that helps optimize model performance by systematically searching through different parameter combinations. By collecting and analyzing the metrics from all completed trial runs, we can make an informed decision about which model configuration to register and deploy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieving sweep information**: Accessing a specific sweep job by name and getting its current status\n",
    "- **Collecting trial runs**: Fetching all individual experiment runs that were part of the hyperparameter sweep\n",
    "- **Setting up MLflow tracking**: Connecting to the Azure ML workspace's MLflow tracking server to access logged metrics\n",
    "- **Extracting performance metrics**: Gathering validation metrics from only the completed runs to ensure valid comparisons\n",
    "- **Ranking configurations**: Creating a sorted DataFrame that ranks model configurations based on validation AUC, with higher values indicating better performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this analysis is complete, we can identify the top-performing model configuration and use its parameters for the final model registration and deployment, ensuring we proceed with the most effective version of our pneumonia detection model."

    "This validation step completes our end-to-end workflow by testing our deployed model with actual patient X-ray data. Testing a deployed endpoint is an essential quality assurance measure that confirms our model is correctly accessible, properly processes inputs, and returns valid predictions in a production environment. By successfully executing this test, we verify that our pneumonia detection solution is ready for integration with clinical systems or other applications, ensuring the transition from development to production has been completed successfully.\n",

    "  - Creating a base64 encoding function to convert DICOM images into a format suitable for API transmission\n",
    "  - Implementing a payload formatter that structures the encoded image according to the expected API schema\n",
    "  - Building a request handler that manages the HTTP POST operation with proper authentication headers\n",
